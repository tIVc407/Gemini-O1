Introduction
============

Gemini-O1 is a powerful multi-agent system that leverages Google's Gemini API to create a network of specialized AI instances that can collaborate on complex tasks.

Key Features
-----------

- **Multi-agent Architecture**: Create specialized AI instances to tackle complex problems
- **Scrum Master Node**: A mother node coordinates tasks and synthesizes responses
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple parallel AI instances
- **Command-based Communication**: Structured command language for agent interaction
- **Multiple Interfaces**: CLI and Web interfaces with visualization tools
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track instance status, history, and network statistics
- **Advanced Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm with exponential backoff for API calls
- **Health Monitoring**: System and API health checks with detailed status reporting
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with request ID tracking across instances
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, linting, and documentation generation
